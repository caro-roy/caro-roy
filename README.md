Hello, I'm Caroline
As astonishing as it can be on github, I'm a software engineer ! ðŸ˜±

# Where I come from

I started development during my physics/robotics studies, with Python, C(++/#) (heck even Matlab and LabView) and I've grown a deep love for it ever since.  
 
4 years ago, I shifted into web dev to get more in touch with more glam âœ¨ user facing solutions. 
This journey started integrating showcase and ecommerce websites ((HTML, (S)CSS and smarty)) for small and medium businesses. I also worked on analytics implementations using GTM to track customers and visitors performances and enjoyed it so much (I have a weird kink for metrics and charts). I didn't know it at the time when trying to figure out what the heck I was writing but this is how I met, not your mother but, JS.

A few months later, I signed a pact with the devil and started learning React that became my tool of choice to deliver interactive and user centric interfaces for applications.

# What's next ?

## In general
- Unravel frontend concepts in depth (performances, accessibility etc) to truly master it someday
- Start growing outside the frontend bubble: open my backend chakras, have a better vision upon UI and UX, teamwork organisation / methods

## Techwise

- Next.js (I'm currently working on projects to apply all my new knowledge regarding rendering strategies, performances and animations)
- Node.js / Express
- Leetcode - DataStructure & Algo 
- Python to step a foot into data analysis, dataviz that spark joy to me
  
... and serendipity while navigating through random tech posts or videos
