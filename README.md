## Where I come from

I started development during my physics/robotics studies, with Python, C(++/#), (heck even Matlab, LabView, ROS and LaTeX) and I've grown a deep love for it ever since.  
 
4 years ago, I shifted into web dev to get more in touch with more glam âœ¨ user facing solutions. 
This journey started integrating showcase and ecommerce websites ((HTML, (S)CSS and smarty)) for SMEs. I also worked on analytics implementations using GTM to track customers and visitors performances and enjoyed it so much (I have a weird kink for metrics and charts). I didn't know it at the time when trying to figure out what the heck I was writing but this is how I met, not your mother but, JS.

A few months later, I signed a pact with the devil and started learning React that became my tool of choice to deliver interactive and user centric interfaces for applications.

## What's next ?


- Next.js (I'm currently working on projects to apply all my new knowledge regarding rendering strategies, performances and animations)
- Node.js / Express
- Leetcode - DataStructure & Algo 
- Python to step a foot into data analysis, dataviz that spark joy to me
- FP (with Scala or Haskell probably)
  
... and serendipity while navigating through random tech posts or videos
