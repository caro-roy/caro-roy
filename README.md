### Hello, I'm Caroline

As astonishing as it can be on github, I'm a software engineer ! ðŸ˜±
I started development during my physics/robotics studies, with Python, C(++/#) (heck even Matlab and LabView) and I've grown a deep love for it ever since.  
 
4 years ago, I shifted into web dev to get more in touch with more glam âœ¨ user facing solutions. 
This journey started integrating showcase and ecommerce website ((HTML, (S)CSS and smarty)) for small and medium businesses. I also worked on analytics implementations using GTM and enjoyed it so much (I have a weird kink for metrics and charts). I didn't know it at the time when trying to figure out what the heck I was writing but this is how I met, not your mother but, JS.

A few months later, I signed a pact with the devil and started learning React.
